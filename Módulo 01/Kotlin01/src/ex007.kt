    *   <variable/constant_type>.SIZE_BITS
    *   <variable/constant_type>.SIZE_BYTES

    *   These two commands works on almost every variable/constant type, except for String
    *   (String uses length command)
    *
    *   You can allow Kotlin to decide which primitive type to use by omitting the variable/constant type.
    *   This is a variable/constant declaration by inference
    *
    *   Any is a flexible variable/constant
